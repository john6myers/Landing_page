This was my first ever time looking at a blank HTML and CSS screen!
At first it was very terrifying but it feels amazing being able to complete it, even if its not perfect!

Ive learned so much taking my time working on this project and im super glad i went back and really tried understanding flexbox.... i still am a little confused but its no where close to when i started this! 

looking forward to larning even more and potentially revisiting this project and making it even better!
